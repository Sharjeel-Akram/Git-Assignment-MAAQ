**GitFlow Process**
Gitflow is a widely recognized and popular branching model and workflow that provides a structured approach to managing the development of software projects. Gitflow is built on top of the Git version control system, which allows multiple developers to work on a project concurrently while maintaining a clean and organized codebase. This workflow defines a set of branching strategies and guidelines, making it easier for teams to manage different aspects of software development, such as feature development, bug fixes, and release management.
